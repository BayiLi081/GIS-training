# What is spatial analysis?

**Spatial analysis is the exploration of data, description of patterns and understanding of nature of relationships in data sets.**

## Types of Spatial Analysis

### Based on data type

- Point Pattern Analysis
- Area (Polygon) Analysis
- Network Analysis
- Analysis of Interaction

### Based on Theme

- Measurements

  Distance & Length, Shape, Slope and Aspect

- Query and Reasoning

  Where is?

  What is this?

  How to get there?

- Transformation and Interplolation

  Buffering, Number of points in polygon, Overlaying, Interpolation

- Descriptive Analysis

  Gravity centres, Dispersion, Nearest neighbour, Spatial autocorrelation, Fragmentation

- Location Optimisation

  Optimum location, routing, location and allocation

- Hypothesis Testing

  Predictive analysis, Confirmatory: Drawing inferences from sample to population, Spatial regression
