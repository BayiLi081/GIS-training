From the feedback collected from first round, the following tasks to improve the quality:

1. OneMap provides good geocoding api for SG addresses. For 3-01 geocoding example, adding OneMap API example could be useful.

2. Raster analysis can be removed as remote sensing analysis is not important skills for urban science students. Make it optional.

3. 1-03 and 3-02 can be merged into one, or the order be more close. Find a better practice example of questionnaire/survey data.

4. 2-01 vector: introducing shapely objects first, then teach how to translate them into GeoDataFrame. Otherwise, can easily get confused.

4. 2-03 Network analysis can use a simple 3x3 Manhattan road network as a example of network distance. Use a complex road network in real world can be confusing.

4. 3-03-02 can teach mapping A data, let the students practice with B data.

5. 3-03-01 static mapping is no longer a big thing to do with Python. Can change to use Python console in QGIS to batch generate journal-quality maps.

6. AI is a big thing now. It is hard to not mention the role of AI-assist coding even AI-generated coding workflow nowadays.
