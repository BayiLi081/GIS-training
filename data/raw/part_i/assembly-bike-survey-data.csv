I acknowledge the paint is newish but I fear it brings with it the same problem as red paint used for ""clearway"" markings does i.e. poor traction in the wet.  This needs attention.    However, the main, and positively dangerous ""advancements"" relate to the way superhighway 7 has been structured at the junction of the A3 and the A23, north-bound and south-bound.  The solution adopted is, in short, absolutely hopeless. I have ridden those junctions every workday for almost 5 years and the superhighway has made them much more dangerous for cyclists.    You should have routed all vehicles south-bound joining the A23 from the A3 down the buslane (they would filter into two lanes once they have got onto the A23), and put kerbstones inbetween the superhighway and the A3.      On the Northbound junction, the blue paint should as a matter of urgency be extended all the way from the traffic lights at Oval Station to the junction, and, much more importantly, the cycle highway should be kerbstoned on either side.  That would force motor vehicles to move early if they wished to filter left to join the A23.  What vehicles in fact do now is accelerate to speeds far in excess of 30mph and then filter left, cutting dangerously in front of cyclists who are northbound on the superhighway.  Accidents and near-misses are commonplace and I will be wholly unsurprised when yet another cycling fatality is announced, at that site.    You need to take on board quickly that kerbstoning works - see for example the junction of the A3 and the A203 at Stockwell - which (credit where it is due) now works very well indeed for cyclists.    There also need to be working speed cameras on that stretch of road.  Motor vehicles routinely drive at 40mph down that stretch of the A3 and 50mph is not uncommon.    I trust my comments are detailed enough for you to make sense of them  - I'd be grateful for a response to them - I repeat the situation is now worse for cyclists at those junctions than that which pertained prior to the changes.",No,No,Pls see detailed comments above.,,"No (if no, go straight to question 12)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I own a bicycle so no need to.

An increase in docking stations would also help alleviate the problem of finding a station empty of bikes, or no docks free to return bike to.

And if the free hire period were extended, even by just 15 minutes, that would increase the incentive to cycle further, as you currently have to dock for 5 minutes and get a new bike to do this.

The best thing about it is the deviation around Elephant and castle roundabout which is very welcome. However the entrance to the deviation is obscured by hoarding and difficult to access safely - the exit is often blocked in heavy traffic by buses. Pedestrians don't know what it is and wander into it. Further on Southwark Bridge road, taxis park in it. The 'cycle superhighway' is merely a blue line painted on the road in a poor position and offers nothing more - cosmetic rather than an improvement to the cycling experience.

Overall I think cars are getting the message and respect the 'cycle' lane.  What I observed is that the quality of the surface varied along the route - maybe to do with when the paint was put in place - it has settled and faded in bits of the route; So the first issue is regarding - enforcement - who will enforce illegal parking along the route? and the other one is maitenance.  Who will maintain the route - is it a TfL responsability or individual boroughs should make sure that the route is clear and clean? Another issue that I would like to bring to your attention is that of continuity - sometimes the blue route disappears and as a first timer using I flet quite confused - I think this happened near Stockwell and also just beyond Oval; in fact between Oval and Kennington the CSH collides with a Green Cycle Route - visually is quite confusing - what does it mean?    Another issue I struggle with is to focus on promoting the facility to commuters - the infra structureis there 24 hours a day and people commute for maybe 4 hours to 6 hours a day - 7 to 10 am and 4 to 7 pm; so the route shoudl be also promoted locally to short trips; most of which are currently done by car; so a big miss oportunity there.

The majority don't do this, perhaps because they don't have the confidence (motorists can be really balshy as it stops them from accelerating quickly as soon as the light turns to green) or perhaps they just don't know.  The problem comes when there are lots of cyclists as if you are not one of the first ones in line then you end up having no choice but to stack up one behind the other in the cycle lane next to the cars (which are often straddling the cycle lane anyhow) - this is not safe.    My only other comment is about motorcyclists - I do not think they should be allowed in cycle lanes as they tend not to be considerate of cyclists and weave in and out at high speeds with no warning.  They also all seem to love revving their engines for no reason whatsoever, which is quite scary if they come up behind you and you're on a bike. This is often dismissed as being a 'girly' issue but I would say that when I lived in Stratford I regularly commuted by bike from Stratford to the City and I was regularly one of the only woman cyclists until I got to Aldgate.

Only cycle short distances in central London using new cycle hire scheme.,Yes,good,fair,very bad,good,good,very bad,bad,very good,"There are two major problems with the scheme:    1. the bikes are not redistributed sensibly as they all come in to central London during the day and leave again at night. Getting a bike at Waterloo after the morning rush hour is hard, while there are no bikes in central London (Westminster) after about 6pm at night, which isn't helpful if you want to do something after work and then cycle back to the station.  Meanwhile, there is a lack of available spaces to return the bikes a lot of the time.  Twice recently I have cycled to the docking point nearest to my destination only to find that it and every other docking station in the area (listed on the computer terminal) were full.  That makes returning the bikes very difficult, especially if you don't know the area and so where the other convenient docking points might be, and makes a very journey very lengthy as you have to circle trying to find available spaces. There is no point in the scheme if in total it takes longer to make the journey by bike than by foot.  This morning it took over 30mins to get from Waterloo to my office on Lower Regent Street as I had to go far out of my way to find a free docking point. There should be more vans moving bikes about when every docking station in an area is full.    2. customer service, both the phone line and website, is bad. Even when you have a simple question unrelated to the details of your account, you have to answer a load of security questions. When I once phoned because I couldn't find a free docking point in the whole of Chelsea I was not given any helpful advice, except that I lock the bike up with a bike lock (which I didn't have). I was promised that some charges would be removed from my account, but they never were.  Friends have also had charges they didn't incur added to their accounts.  When I first got a key, it didn't work in some docking points despite the fact it was activated - when I called up to ask why, all I was told that some keys weren't working in some docking points - ie. not helpful advice.

I also regularly cycled over to Covent Garden or elsewhere in the West End at lunchtime, all told a pleasant and healthy injection of exercise into an otherwise largely sedentary day. In rcent weeks, however, I have stopped using the scheme in the morning and evening, simply because I generally can't find a bike in the morning, nor can I find a spare docking station at Ch.X unless I leave the office in Wloo unsustainably early. Similarly, whilst I can find a bike easily enough to head over the river during the day, it takes an age to find free docking stations in the West End, which for me completely wipes out the benefits of ad hoc bike use - surely it's supposed to be quicker than being a pedestrian, not add 20 mins or more of frantic dock searching to a journey? On another issue, the gearing on the bikes seems wrong to me. It's ludicrously easy to find onself ""overpedalling"" in 3rd gear, with nowhere else to go.

If so it is entirely wrong to only use blue paint on half the widths of the bus lanes (actually it's wrong to do this in any case).  - Is it to communicate the identity of the route and thus aid navigation?

However, some docking stations are rather hard to find (tucked away in side streets).  Could signage be improved?  Also, the lack of docking stations in the West End is offputting.  Generally, a denser network of docking stations is needed.  And there are some obvious gaps (Storey's Gate, Tate Britain being two that are crying out for docking stations asap).   Also need more 'complementary measures'  to make it easier to access docking stations and use the scheme generally - the maze of one-way streets in Westminster would be farcical if it weren't so serious.... a real barrier to cycling and walking in central London.",

I got very excited when it was first announced. My partner is a doctor. He wants to cycle to work in his hospital and we thought the CSH would help him feel safe enough on the roads to do that. CSH7 doesn't do that. It's a joke. He needs to cycle at all sorts of hours. we've done a couple of test runs and the basic experience is that CSH7 is some blue paint. With cars parked in it. It doesn't make him feel any safer. So he's going to continue driving to the hospital. And I think he's right.     I work in a large team in the City. A lot of the people who work for me say they would like to cycle but are too scared to cycle in London. A few of them have seen CSH7 but all they see is blue paint.     I have cycled alon ghte CSH7 route for a year. The only reason I use the route is that it is a protected bus lane. And so I feel safer cycling that route. But only in the hours that hte bus lane operates. Outside of those hours I chose to use either public transport or drive. The reason is that the bus lane baically turns into a lane for minicab drivers to overtake me at 60mph and undercut traffic in the main lanes. It feels very unsafe.     There are a number of junctions on the route that are downright dangerous and I don't think the CSH has done much to improve them.     I have used CSH3 only twice. For most of the route, it is exactly the same as it was before but now it's blue.

My mum, my dad and my niece all toddled along on bikes. If you want to encourage people to swap cars for bikes, you need to allow them to feel safe, to feel they can do it in normal clothes. Your CSHs are only useful if I dress up in lycra, with a helmet, and I sprint like crazy to keep at the same speed as the traffic to get through junctions.     Fed up of cyclists jumping red lights and behaving like idiots? Then stop forcing us to behave like that.

However using it during peak rush hour (which is when I would personally most benefit) is much more difficult due to bike availability.  I understand that the scheme was not originally intended as a replacement for commuters, but if you don't want people to use it for commuting then you should either have a charge or not supply large numbers of bikes to the mainline stations.  As it is, bikes are continually brought to the stations in the mornings, and hence if there is one available I will take it - usually to find that the whole of Soho is heaving with no spaces.  Managing commuters is going to be a difficult job - you can't possibly cater for everyone!  Having manned stations like recently in Soho Square so that there is at least one main point in each area where you can definitely leave a bike would be an improvement, and even better if this was published and committed to.    I love the service, but I recognise that my type of use (tube replacement / all journeys less than 30 minutes) is a costly one for the scheme.",

Further, as some of the highways are in bus lanes I have seen a number of near misses as bikes travel down the side of buses and then get squeezed into the curb as the buses move into stops – again I think this is caused by a false sense of security.

To me, and almost everyone else I've spoken to, this implies the route should be a route specifically for cyclists. This is not the case in the slightest. The Superhighways are mediocre at best.     I live in Camden so I only occasionally use CS7 on the way to a friend's. On the few times I have used it, I've come across buses and even cars parked in the superhighway. Cars wouldn't park in an equivalent superhighway for cars. The Cycle Superhighway is therefore pretty meaningless.     I still don't understand why they weren't separated from the road. I cycle in Bloomsbury on a separated cycle route and it's brilliant. It's the only bit of my daily journey where I'm not harassed by motorists. I read somewhere that the belief was there weren't enough cyclists for it to be separated. But if it were separate, then there would be lots of cyclists using it. The route in Bloomsbury, along Torrington Place is used constantly and it certainly hasn't benefitted from the same promotion the Superhighways have. Like the way car traffic expands to fill newly built roads, if you build it, they will come.    I think another excuse you used was that cyclists don't want segregation. But you need to ask those who aren't cycling whether they want segregation. If you were actually wanted to increase cycling, as you say you do, those are the people the people you need to listen to.    I like that the fact the Superhighways are nice and smooth. Perhaps the blue strip makes me slightly safer than a green one. Maybe the lorries, buses, cars and motorbikes are slightly more aware I'm there.

They aren't properly segregated. you've made junctions like Oval more dangerous. You've not provided any sensible approach to the CSH from major contributory roads. At weekends and at night they are filled with parked cars and used as fast speed lanes by cars trying to undertake the main lane. There are a few parts that work better but they are really limited. I think most of the junctions have been made more dangerous for cyclists because you haven't actually allocated space to cyclists. You need to make the CSHs spaces where it is safe to cycle and where cycles are dominant, not just fitting in around everything else. They need to work at weekends and at night.

Even if I turn left towards Waterloo here, you've narrowed the road space so that cars try to overtake on the turning and cut me up.     Heading south, you have designed a facility that forces me to sit behind a queue of other motor vehicles that may be heading straight on or turning left towards Brixton Road. Now I just get cut up all the time or have to swerve in and out of lanes.     If I approach this junction from Brixton Road, I still have to slip down the side of buses in the pathetically small cycle space on the left hand side, then follow a blue line that allows motor vehicles to overtake me and then try and cut back into the main motor traffic flow to continue north to Elephant. This is insanely complicated, full of conflict points, and downright dangerous.     At Southwark Bridge north end, to continue straight over into the City, I now have to contend with a lot of lorries in the left hand lane turning right.

Also, there have been some insane set ups created during the construction of the CS.

Cycles wishing to continue along the CS have to cycle into the all-vehicles lane.

Outside of these hours, there is effectively no lane as there are countless numbers of legally parked vehicles on the red route.

I actually cycle a long way around Tooting High Street when the CS is inactive during the day for two reasons: 1. it is genuinely dangerous when there are vehicles parked on this narrow, extremely busy high street and 2.  there is not enough room to cycle alongside vehicles when there are parked vehicles so cycles are forced to stay in line / behind the rest of the very slow moving traffic.  Roads like Tooting High Street REALLY need to have double red lines along their entirety with loading bays created only on the side roads.

This is permitted in the Superhighway cycle lanes in some areas during off-peak periods. Car parking should not be allowed in cycle lanes at any time – the cycle superhighways are not just used by work commuters. Allowing parking in cycle lanes also encourages motorists not to take them seriously. Anything called a “Superhighway” should be available around the clock.  2. Intermittent cycle lanes. Two dangerous examples I recently came across on CS7 are: i) immediately south of Southwark bridge where the nice, safe segregated cycle lane suddenly ends at a row of parked coaches, forcing cyclists back out into the path of traffic and ii) where the A23 turns left across the Superhighway, which continues straight on – the cycle lane disappears and the road markings encourage cyclists to change lanes at the last minute, across the path of fast-moving traffic.  3. Priority at traffic lights. The “bypass” around the Elephant and Castle roundabout crosses several small side-roads – and each one needs to be negotiated with the aid of traffic lights (sometimes two sets per road). These are phased with the motorist in mind and it takes an age to get around the bypass. A true “Superhighway” should have priority – with the lights changing when the button is pressed.  4.

Infrastructure which directs cyclists into risky situations is far more dangerous than no cycle-specific infrastructure at all.    3. Routes offered as alternatives to main roads are unattractive as they contain too many junctions which require stopping, for example the one which circumvents the Elephant and Castle roundabout.     4. This junction also has various parts of the pavement which are simply painted blue, presumably as they are meant to be ""shared"" with pedestrian but as the entire pavement is blue, rather than being split, people understandably walk on all parts of the pavement making cycling at speed impossible.

I initially took one key, with the access period set as daily usage, as I did not want weekly or annual membership.  Later I called up to request 2 further keys for when my wife and son might accompany me on a trip to London.  Luckily the Customer Service pointed out that access fees for  the additional keys would each be charged every time I used my key regardless of whether the additional keys were used.    Thanks to that member of your staff for pointing that out to me.  This issue of charging for all keys every time an access period is started is not explained at all clearly on your publicity material – either printed or on the website.  Looking at the map/leaflet sent out with my key, it says: “Provide family and friends access and keys of their own..”, but fails to point out that an additional access charge will be made regardless of how many keys are actually used in a given period.  I then thought that I could opt for Annual member ship, but this would generate a charge of £45 per additional key.  Can I suggest that the website needs an urgent overhaul to spell out the effect of additional keys on an account, and make clear exactly what taking extra keys will mean.  I did read the terms and conditions, but it’s a bit buried away in there, and how many users will genuinely read the T&Cs in their entirety?  Perhaps it’s time to establish an FAQs page to deal with this issue and others that have cropped up in the first weeks of the scheme.  Please reconsider the account system, so that additional keys only incur an access charge, when they are used to release a cycle.",

The issue is that a newbie will follow the lane and need to pull out at the last moment to avoid running into a parked vehicle.

Previously I had either walked, got public transport or drived to get around London.    I have found cycling to be an enjoyable, economical and efficient way to get around and have been using it more frequently than I would have expected.    Before I started cycling I had not paid much attention to the cycling infrastructure (or lack thereof) in London, but now that I have used it I have to say it is really very poor quality.    The bike hire scheme is great, very convenient with a lot of docking stations and a pricing scheme that makes it very good value for most trips in central London. But other than that, provisions for cyclist in the city are laughable.    Cycle lanes are extremely narrow, forcing the rider to cycle just beside the curb, when all the safety advice is that riding too close to the curb encourages unsafe overtaking by motorists. In addition,  many cycle lanes are advisory only, and in my experience so far the advice is not generally taken. Similarly it's rare that I find one of the boxes for cyclists at lights not occupied by cars.    I have ridden on the last part of CS7 several times. It is wider than other cycle lanes, which is definitely a good thing, but it still has the problem of parked cars and drivers not paying attention to the boundary. Also these routes cover such a small percentage of London roads that they are irrelevant for most journeys.    The mayor's office has been making a big push to extol the virtues of cycling, through the massive amount of publicity for the hire scheme, superhighways and events such as last weeks sky-ride, but I think that if it's a serious aim rather than just a way to get good publicity, there is a massive amount of work needed to make cycling a realistic mode of transport for most Londoners.    To be more specific, I think the following would be a good place to start:  - Make cycle lanes prohibited for motorist rather than advisory.  - Widen cycle lanes - they could be much wider on many roads in the centre. I'm thinking Holland / Denmark here.  - Remove parking bays, taxi parking etc to make room for the improved cycling infrastructure.  - Enforce a minimum passing distance of <tbd> metres when overtaking a cyclist.    Now a lot of of these measures would not be popular with many motorists, and special interest groups such as black cabs, but ultimately if you want to increase the use of a form of transport on our roads, you need to incentivise people to use it, and currently many people feel (rightly) that cycling in London is too dangerous to be a viable option. There is a limited amount of space on the roads in the capital and promoting cycling means setting aside space for cyclists which will mean reducing the space available to motorists. Without drastic measures such as this I do not think cycling in London will move past its current novelty status for most people.",No,No,,,Yes,very bad,very good,very good,very good,fair,very good,good,fair,"Registration process marked down as the url for the page could not be resolved by the DNS servers of my ISP (O2), so I had to change my DNS to use google before I could even open the page! Most people would just not have bothered I think.    The docking stations are great, there really are so many of them it's quite remarkable. I've never found myself having to ride very far from where I want to go to dock the bike. Occasionally I've had problems with stations being full when I want to dock or empty when I want a bike but on the whole I think a good job is being done of moving the bikes around according to demand.     The bike has plusses and minuses. It's very easy to ride, even with one hand off to signal and looking behind it still stays in a straight line, which is great for people such as myself who are cycling for the first time in many years. Also the seat height is very easy to adjust and the saddle is very comfortable. On the minus side, it's amazingly heavy, around twice as heavy as most bikes you'd buy for commuting. It needs to be sturdy but I think 20kg is just too much. The gearing is very low, even in the highest gear it's hard to build up a decent amount of speed (though in many cases including my own, this is probably a good thing). Finally on several occasions I've found a bike with a very over tightened rear brake, now I check before undocking.

You miss out issues such as the speeds that vehicles are moving around you at - the max speed should be 20mph for people to feeel safe. The other things is the qulaity of the lanes (not just their width). Firstly they are frequently parked in which pushes you out into the fast flowing vehicles. Secondly they are not protected - thus vehicles can enter them and one has no real protection from vehicles. For example Southwark Bridge itself feels safe as the lanes are protected. The approaches to the bridge from the south are simply not safe and there are stretches on Southwark Bridge Rd where owing to bends and a lack of protection where longer vehicles are forced into the cycle lane. There is simply not enough protection to be encouraging novice cyclists onto these routes.,No,No,As noted above - a 20mph speed is needed whereever there is a cycle superhighway.

I have been reluctant to cycle my own bike in Central London in the past due to the fear it will be stolen.   I hope that funds are found so that the scheme is dramatically extended as I believe it is green, helps get people fit and would seem to cost much less than major transport infrastructure projects. I have the following comments from my experience over the last fortnight using Cycle Hire.   1. Docking stations aren't easy to find as they are all in side streets (recently I rode to Paddington Station and took ages to find the docking hidden away in Eastbourne Mews). How about painting small blue arrows on the main roads when you are within, say 200m of a docking station (this could be done quite subtly so scheme users recognise the sign but it wouldn't be ugly)?  2. We need more docking stations straight outside stations or on broad pieces of pavement on main roads (it seems that whoever chose the sites was trying to hide them away; this is very different to Paris where you will find a massive site bang outside the Gare du Lyon)  3. Although I understand Serco are trying to manage it there are some stations that seem doomed to be empty when I need a bike (e.g. Porchester Place, W2 is always empty after 9am) and others, e.g. in Covent Garden, that are full throughout the day.  4. I have had no mechanical problems with the bikes which seem v sturdy and a pleasure to ride.  5. I have often found a docking station will not release a bike after I put in my key; typically though it works second or third time when you try to release another bike.",Several times a week,A combination of the above,,Less than 30 mins,Yes,My log-in password for the website wasn't working,Good,It was fine,You can't always get through on the helpline number,

I realise that it's costly to change the infrastructure of London to the extent that it will actually be cycle friendly. However, in saying that, I think there are many ways in which the Cycle Superhighway needs improvement. My comments pertain to CS7 along the A3 from Elephant & Castle to Clapham Common. The cycle lane is often interrupted by bus stops forcing cyclists into traffic lanes to avoid buses. The bus lane was not widened when the cycle lane was painted in, so even though there is a cycle lane marked out, buses and other traffic must still drive dangerously close to cyclists to overtake. Cars often park in the cycle lane, especially in Clapham, rendering the lane useless. The junction with the A23 by Kennington Park does not provide a safe lane for cyclists wishing to carry on down the A3--three lanes of traffic must be crossed. I've cycled this road for five years and find that it's no safer with the blue paint than it was when it was green paint. It's just got more signage now. Things that would make me feel safer would be to actually widen the road to give us more space. Get cyclists away from the bus lane so we're not constantly ""leap frogging"" buses which is dangerous and frightening. Re-design busy junctions so cyclists can cross vehicles at a traffic light rather than having to cross lanes of fast-moving traffic.",No,No,"On a positive note, the signage and cycle-traffic lights which take you around the outside of the Elephant & Castle roundabout is much improved and easier to follow now.",,Yes,fair,fair,fair,,,,,fair,I've registered but haven't used a bike yet.

I don't want to be called back in 4 days when I am trying to dock a cycle now! I suspect the overflow centre is a ploy by Serco to ensure that they meet contractual targets.,"1. You need to sort out the tidal flow problem. The system is much less useful than it should be because either there are no cycles or you can't dock them. 35% of attempts to get and 35% of attempt to dock a cycle fail! Makes the system almost not worth using. This is worse now than a month ago. You need more docking stations before more cycles. And many more in central London before you put them at terminus stations.  2. If one empty space remains and it will not accept the cycle I am trying to dock, the computer will not tell me where other empty stations are because it thinks there is one available where I am.

Can that be policed, at least for a time, to remind the traffic of the rules?

The membership pack arrived very promptly indeed.    Overall, I love the scheme and it has improved my quality of life tremendously. I feel fitter and happier and ""empowered"" by having another way to make journeys which puts me in control rather than having to wait for buses etc. As an annual member I also think it is excellent value for money for the user. The scheme is a very significant enhancement to life in London.    The main experience of which I would be critical is dealing with the call centre/customer services in trying to register and resolve my complaints about overcharging.  Fortunately I have only ever been overcharged very small amounts, but it has been a titanic battle to get anybody to respond substantively to me (as opposed to promising callbacks which never happen) and one of my overcharges, on 11 August, has never been resolved at all despite my emails and phone calls.    The other big problem, which I find understandable at this early stage, is matching supply and demand for bikes and docking spaces.  My daily commute involves a journey from Islington (Angel or Clerkenwell stations) to Holborn-area stations in the morning, and the reverse in the evening.  In both cases my timings put me somewhat behind the peak of the rush hour (significantly later in the evening).     It is increasingly difficult to find a bike available in Islington in the morning, and virtually impossible to find one in the Holborn area beyond 5.30 in the evening (I leave work between 6.30pm and 7pm). There is likely to be enormous unmet demand in the Holborn area - and probably the City too - for bikes in the evening, and yet restocking generally does not seem to happen until much later at night.  I would say, however, that the morning docking situation in Holborn has been greatly improved in recent weeks by active dock management at Holborn Circus, which is much appreciated.",Several times a week,A combination of the above,"Mostly (on my daily commute each way) it is instead of the bus, but I have also made journeys on the cycle hire bike which have replaced Tube journeys or walking, in addition to making journeys which I would not otherwise have taken at all but I take a bike out for pleasure/fitness.",Less than 30 mins,Yes,"Overcharging (namely charging £1 to my account on journeys where I ought to have been given an extra 15 mins to dock, there being no spaces free).

In the other case the docking station terminal was not working at all but I had registered my need for extra time with the call centre; again it did not materialise and I was charged as though I did not have the extra time.",Very poor,"Hopeless!    My email of complaint of 9 August was finally responded to (and the charge removed) on 29 August after two phone calls in the interim.    My email of 11 August, dealing with a separate instance of overcharging, has still not been responded to (it is now 10 September) despite being discussed in the same two telephone conversations in which the staff member confirmed that it has reached my file. The overcharge remains on my user account.    What is immensely frustrating is that one rarely if ever gets through to anybody with the power to do anything other than to promise a ""callback"" which never, ever, happens. The whole thing is completely maddening and significantly undermines confidence in those running the system who, after all, have access to users' bank accounts. I have lost the will to keep arguing with them about the odd £1 here and there, but who knows when they will overcharge me by significantly more than that?","I'm not sure how to suggest improvements without knowing why things are as bad as they are.     Certainly my first experience of customer services (my key activation call on 3 August) was excellent - I got straight through to somebody who was able to deal with me and he was courteous and efficient. Since then I have not had a single positive experience with them. The people I speak to are pleasant but apparently never in a position to do anything other than promise, in vain, that a callback will happen within 24 hours.
